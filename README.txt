Version 1.4   -   Updated: Jun. 14, 2012

This Plug-In will create a custom tooltip. It is extremely lightweight
and very smart in that it detects the edges of the browser window and 
will make sure the tooltip stays within the current window size. As a 
result the tooltip will adjust itself to be displayed above, below, to 
the left or to the right depending on what is necessary to stay within 
the browser window. It is completely customizable as well via CSS.
